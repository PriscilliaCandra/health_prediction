# Diabetes and Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Description
Diabetes and Heart Disease Prediction is an application that allows users to predict the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease based on their health parameters. The application utilizes a trained Random Forest Classifier model and provides an intuitive interface for users to get predictions easily.

## Key Features
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease based on user input.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays prediction results in an easy-to-understand bar chart.
- **Simple and User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive experience.

## How It Works
1. Users enter their health parameters such as age, blood pressure, glucose level, etc.
2. The system processes the input data and applies the trained Random Forest Classifier model.
3. The application displays the prediction results, indicating the risk of diabetes or heart disease.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/diabetes-heart-disease-prediction.git
cd diabetes-heart-disease-prediction
```

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit (Web-based UI)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning with Random Forest Classifier)
- Pandas & NumPy (Data processing and manipulation)
